# LearningPython
This is some fun projects that I created while learning python and also contain the game of "Rock|Paper|Scissor" in the file `RockPaperScissor.py`.
Also I learned about how to connect database to your file and modify data, I have created a program to get data from database from date to date, it is available in file `view_data.py`
